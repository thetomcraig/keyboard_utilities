/*
 * Sends a command/data sequence that can include restarts, writes and reads. Every transmission begins with a START,
 * and ends with a STOP so you do not have to specify that.
 *
 * sequence is the I2C operation sequence that should be performed. It can include any number of writes, restarts and
 * reads. Note that the sequence is composed of uint16_t, not uint8_t. This is because we have to support out-of-band
 * signalling of I2C_RESTART and I2C_READ operations, while still passing through 8-bit data.
 *
 * sequence_length is the number of sequence elements (not bytes). Sequences of arbitrary length are supported. The
 * minimum sequence length is (rather obviously) 2.
 *
 * received_data should point to a buffer that can hold as many bytes as there are I2C_READ operations in the
 * sequence. If there are no reads, 0 can be passed, as this parameter will not be used.
 *
 * callback_fn is a pointer to a function that will get called upon successful completion of the entire sequence. If 0 is
 * supplied, no function will be called. Note that the function will be called fron an interrupt handler, so it should do
 * the absolute minimum possible (such as enqueue an event to be processed later, set a flag, exit sleep mode, etc.)
 *
 * user_data is a pointer that will be passed to the callback_fn.
