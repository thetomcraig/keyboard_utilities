## KLL Configuration ##

# Generally shouldn't be changed, this will affect every layer
BaseMap="scancode_map"

# This is the default layer of the keyboard
# NOTE: To combine kll files into a single layout, separate them by spaces
# e.g.  DefaultMap="mylayout mylayoutmod"
DefaultMap="animation_test stdFuncMap"

# This is where you set the additional layers
# NOTE: Indexing starts at 1
# NOTE: Each new layer is another array entry
# e.g.  PartialMaps[1]="layer1 layer1mod"
#       PartialMaps[2]="layer2"
#       PartialMaps[3]="layer3"
PartialMaps[1]="ic60/hhkbpro2"
PartialMaps[2]="colemak"
