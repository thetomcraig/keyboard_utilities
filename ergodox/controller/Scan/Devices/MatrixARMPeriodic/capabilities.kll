# Defines available to the MatrixArmPeriodic sub-module

# This defines the minimum amount of time after a transition until allowing another transition
# Generally switches require a minimum 5 ms debounce period
# Giving an additional 1 ms for misc switches
# Since a decision can usually be made quite quickly, there is little latency on each press
# However, this defines the latency at which the switch state can change
MinDebounceTime => MinDebounceTime_define;
MinDebounceTime = 6; # 6 ms

# This defines the number of clock cycles between periodic scans
# i.e. Between each strobe of the matrix there is a delay to allow for other system processing
# It is highly dependent on the MCU clock speed; however, debounce time is handled in absolute time
# so there is generally little worry about scanning too quickly other than starving other functions.
# If you scan too slowly, keypresses may be slow/delayed, or even dropped.
PeriodicCycles => PeriodicCycles_define;
PeriodicCycles = 1000; # 1000 cycles

# This option delays each strobe by the given number of microseconds
# By default this should *NOT* be set unless your keyboard is having issues
# Delaying more than 10 usecs may cause significant slow-downs with other keyboard functions
StrobeDelay => StrobeDelay_define;
StrobeDelay = 0; # Disabled
#StrobeDelay = 10; # 10 us

# [In]Activity trigger settings
# Will send a trigger once every tick (default 1 second intervals) during inactivity or activity.
# The first tick is immediate with no wait (0th tick).
# After 255 ticks, the ticks stop until the keyboard has activity and goes inactive again (or vice versa).
ActivityTimerMultiplier => ActivityTimerMultiplier_define;
ActivityTimerMultiplier = 1; # 1 second by default
#ActivityTimerMultiplier = 60; # 60 seconds between each tick
